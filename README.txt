
NOTE: This builds with SDL 3.0, but the repo is archived and no further work is planned.
      If this library is useful to you, and you would like to reopen development, please let us know!

This library allows you to display simple Rich Text Format (RTF) files in SDL applications.

The RTF format specification is available at:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnrtfspec/html/rtfspec.asp

The showrtf example application relies on the SDL_ttf library for loading
fonts and displaying text.
The SDL_ttf library can be found at: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf

This library is under the zlib license, see the file "LICENSE.txt" for details.

Enjoy!
