
This library allows you to display simple Rich Text Format (RTF) files in
SDL applications.

The RTF format specification is available at:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnrtfspec/html/rtfspec.asp

The showrtf example application relies on the SDL_ttf library for loading
fonts and displaying text.
The SDL_ttf library can be found at: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf

This library is under the zlib license, see the file "LICENSE.txt" for details.

Enjoy!
